- command interpreter (shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B ./hsh
.I COMMAND
.I [ARGUMENT]

.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

Creates a C shell that runs in interactive and non-interactive mode, similar to the basic "sh" shell. For more details, please refer to the README.md on the Github repository at https://github.com/TheMasterTz/simple_shell/blob/main/README.md. The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. This program can be run on top of another shell.

.SH INVOCATION

Compile simple_shell with the GNU Compiler Collection, preferably using gcc plus the below specified flags, as per this example (note the use of the * wildcard which enables all related .c files to be compiled concurrently):
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
simple_shell can be run in interactive mode by entering the below command on the command line followd by "enter." Note that the prompt ("$ ") will appear and you will then be in interactive mode and able to enter commands followed by "enter."
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE
simple_shell can be run in non-interactive mode through the use of shell scripts. This can involve the use of piping ('|'):
.P
.RS
.B echo 'pwd' | ./hsh

.SH PATH SEARCH

When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name. Then it looks for a builtin command by that name. If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:
.PP
     1.   Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing any searches.
.PP
     2.   The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name. The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.

.SH BUILTINS

The following builtin commands are supported:

.IT
.B env
- prints the environment variables

.B exit
- exits the program

.SH OTHER
.PP
At this time, some shell functions are not supported.
